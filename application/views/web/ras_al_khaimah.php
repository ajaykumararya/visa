                            development in Ras Al-Khaimah is the longest zipline in the world built on Jebel Jais
                            mountains.</p>

                <p>The region holds prominence for its historical excavations that prove the emirate has been inhabited
                    since the 3rd century. The emirate offers the most beautiful sunsets in the country. Give your
                    hiking skills a treat at Dhayan Fort. The military tower was one of the defence mechanisms in the
                    past. If you haven't taken a road trip to the Hajar Mountains, your trip is not a trip. Climb the
                    Jebel Jais to capture some of the most scenic panoramas of the country. Peace and serenity are
                    widespread on this horizon. Adventurous activities are a vital part of <strong>Ras al-Khaimah
                        tourism</strong>.</p>

                    in the natural springs at Hatt Fort. The majestic structure is a living example of ancient Islamic
                    architecture.</p>
